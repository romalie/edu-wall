After all this exploring and science, it's time to relax a little. How about a trip to Titan, moon of Saturn? It is known for its mysterious golden atmosphere, which reveals a breathtaking view of Saturn and its rings. Here, a trip to the beach would be pretty chilly though: the average temperature on Titan is around -179? Celsius. But you could go on a boat trip on the many lakes and rivers, made of liquid methane and ethane. These liquids even evaporate and rain down again, similar to the water cycle on Earth.
