title: Gathering At Göbelki Tepe
---
Between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago, ourancestors built the first temple in human history: Göbekli Tepe. About a thousand people from all over the Middle East gathered here at least once a year to participate in religious rituals. As far as we know, this was the first time in human history that such a big group of people came together in one place. This was a problem for the hunter-gatherer societies: How could they feed so many people at once? Scientists have identified the wild wheat still growing around the temple as the closest relative to the wheat we eat today. So the celebrations at Göbekli Tepe might have been a nudge towards the domestication of crops in this area.
