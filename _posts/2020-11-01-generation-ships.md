Reaching far away stars takes ages, but human lives are quite short, unfortunately. Generation ships may depart the solar system with passengers aboard who will never see the destination. Generations and centuries pass until their descendants arrive. Maybe we could even store our DNA or embryos in a vessel, send it out into space and let an automated system raise us when it's time.
