With the rise of the Industrial Revolution, cities became larger and larger until many of them formed huge urban areas. The population of New York skyrocketed from less than a million people to more than 5 million within just 50 years.

By thebeginning of the last century, New York had become the bright skyline full of cultural offerings and entertainment it is today.
