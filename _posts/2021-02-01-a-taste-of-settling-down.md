Humans were hunters and gatherers for thousands of years before they started to settle down and commit to agriculture. Back then, they already included grains in their diet, but they had to resort to tricks sometimes: The early Natufian people, for example, wandered around in circles in the Middle East in order to maximize their yield. The grains and crops they found were crushed in grinders and mortars, and then used to bake bread similar to a modern wrap from as early on as 14,000 years ago, and even brew alcoholic beverages similar to beer at least 13,000 years ago. The special status of these foods might have played a role in the shift towards crop domestication about 4,000 years later.
