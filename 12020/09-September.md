# PLUTO'S CRATER MIRROR

This is Pluto, a dwarf planet on the rim of our solar system. From here, the Sun is just a tiny dot in the sky, leaving Pluto's surface in the dark. But this makes it theperfect location for a super telescope. Polished craters or spinning liquid salts provide the smooth surfaces needed to focus light to see into the unveiled past of even the faintest stars. The light we see through these telescopes has travelled through space so long that some of the stars that emitted it might not exist anymore.
