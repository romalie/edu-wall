# HELIUM 3 MINING

In the future we will need more power! The answer could be Helium 3, a rare isotope, which can be used to power nuclear fusion reactors. It's found on planets like Uranus and Neptune, which are ravaged by violent storms, so robots could take over the job of harvesting it. As we did on Venus, gas balloons let our equipment float through the planet's dense atmosphere, so no fuel is needed for the robots' lift.
