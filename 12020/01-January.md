# SPACE ELEVATOR

We will start out on Earth, our home. Our first hurdle is finding a way to get to space that's cheaper than rockets. We could overcome this problem with a genius construction: space elevators. They use the energy of Earth's rotation to launch cargo, which reduces launch costs from tens of thousands to only a few hundred dollars per kilogram. All we need is a very long tether that is anchored to Earth's equator on one end, and a counterweight on the other end out in space. As the Earth spins the tether tightens, flinging it around itself like a planetary hammer thrower. Climbers use the tether to transport cargo and passengers to and from orbit, like a rope to the sky.
